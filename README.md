# The-Ring-Dawnspire
Hi! Howdy! Welcome! :)
So I doubt I will get very far with this little side project but I wanna see how far this will take me and hopefully learn something with it!
The only goal I have so far is to make a better overall game then The Ring while practicing and getting better with Javascript. 


# What I plan to add:
- Visuals and text on the screen instead of in a terminal (I find making basic use of a terminal to be cute, but actual visuals and onscreen text on a bigger screen would be a HUGE step up then just using Pythons terminal)
- Making choices via clicking button inputs (Much better then typing out inputs on keyboard)
- Locations you can move around and explore
- A more expanded upon combat system inspired by The Ring
- A somewhat coherent story (I dont plan to make a large scale story, but there will be NPCs you can talk to and light choices you can make.)
